<p>I am currently flying back from a trip to Salt Lake City and decided to post something
more of a personal thought.  I have had some stressful times as of recently and it has
been something that has kept me more on my feet beyond anything.  It also has given me
a realization about our drives and motivations.</p>

<p>We easily fall into a matter of “comfortablility” in which we are happy with what we
are given and therefore, lose that motivation to continue and pursue something bigger.</p>

<p>I am currently in the process of losing a relationship and a friend for the time being.
Though I do not want to get too much into detail about this, I do want to elaborate more
on my mindset and how previous experience how shown that these sort of situations can
become a blessing in disguise.</p>

<p>In the process of a break up, it is very easy to fall into that mode of living where you
feel like your life does not suffice because you are unable to maintain that relationship.
What used to be habit and daily activities are gone and you must suddenly take all this
in and immediately habituate yourself to the siutation.</p>

<p>Most people see these sort of situations as being very detrimental in our lives.  However,
I want to go out on a limb and say that this sort of situation can actually be a blessing
in disguise.</p>

<p>Now I will go in and say that my mindset is very flustered,  I am constantly thinking, I
do get those very low images of myself from the situation.  However, something else has risen
from this event.  My motivation has been grown back into the place that I want it to be.  I
have become more organized than I have been in a while.  My thoughts have become more concentrated.</p>

<p>This recent trip has taught me a lot and given me a very clear idea of what I need to do.  My focus
on myself has grown.  Now, the question that you may be asking is how has a bad situation like this
giving you the ability to give yourself more focus.  The answer to that comes from trying to fill
your brain with these tasks rather than the sad thoughts that may come to you when you do not keep
your mind active.</p>

<p>Without these thoughts to keep my mind busy and to keep myself active, my brain will immediately
fall into that category of reminiscing all the good times that you once had with your significant
other or even fall into the habits that you used to fall into.</p>

<p>With that in mind, I leave you with this.  You want to change the world.  You want to become something
better for yourself.  We all fall into bad situations and even bad days.  Take these tasks and pull
your mind away from the real world.  Go and work on your project.  Whether it be an art project, dance,
programming task, financial ventures, etc.</p>
