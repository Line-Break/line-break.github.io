title: Vacation as Motivation
category: Motivation

So it is roughly a month away before I get a two week vacation to the beautiful country of Vietnam.
I have a lot of family there and it is always such a treat to be able to spend a few weeks without
worrying about life and responsibilities.  Though I have a vacation coming up soon,  this gives
me a new sense of motivation for vacations.  Some things that I realized is that I really need
to brush up on my vietnamese.  To give you an idea, I have about the language comprehension of a
12 year old when it comes to speaking vietnamese.  This gave me the drive to learn as much as I
can before the vacation.

Thinking about this, I had a realization about motivating myself before the vacation time.  I
thought that if I apply this to learning a language, I can use this with everything that I am
goaling towards right now.

For instance, I am also looking to get more in shape before I go so I can appreciate my physical
self while I am on vacation and eat as much as I want without feeling guilty.  I feel like this
is also good motivation to getting in shape as well.

How can this apply to my coding?  I can use this month to really take as much as I can working
on personal projects and learning new things so that I can have that sense of satisfaction
before I can give my mind the rest.  Think of it as that last strong push before resting.

An update to learning Ruby and Rails.  Things are going quite decently, even though I am not
the biggest fan of rails structure of convention over configuration "The idea that if you follow
a certain convention, you don't have to do all the configuration yourself".  I prefer having
the control and knowledge of what I can do.  I hope to create some notes on some of the
things I have learned coming from a python side.  Maybe a "Learn Ruby from the Python Side".
