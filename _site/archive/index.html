            <a href="/motivation/2014/03/18/back-in-la/">Back in LA - 18 Mar 2014</a>
                      <p>It has been a little over a month since my move back to LA and it has definitely been a challenging and
fun journey.  But a little recap on what has happened the past few months.</p>

            <a href="/motivation/2013/12/28/new-year/">New Year - 28 Dec 2013</a>
                      <p>This year has definitely been a crazy one.  It has treated itself similar to one of those epic roller coaster rides.i
While there are many things that I could have done but decided not to, I cannot help but appreciate everything that has
happened in my life.  Good or bad, they have become footprints in my ever going life.  But now starts a new year and
yet another path to create many more footprints to come.</p>

            <a href="/motivation/2013/12/08/vacation-as-motivation/">Vacation as Motivation - 08 Dec 2013</a>
                      <p>So it is roughly a month away before I get a two week vacation to the beautiful country of Vietnam.
I have a lot of family there and it is always such a treat to be able to spend a few weeks without
worrying about life and responsibilities.  Though I have a vacation coming up soon,  this gives
me a new sense of motivation for vacations.  Some things that I realized is that I really need
to brush up on my vietnamese.  To give you an idea, I have about the language comprehension of a
12 year old when it comes to speaking vietnamese.  This gave me the drive to learn as much as I
can before the vacation.</p>

            <a href="/motivation/2013/10/19/use-projects-to-challenge-learning/">Use Ideas to Challenge Your Learning - 19 Oct 2013</a>
                      <p>So there has been something that I have recently been getting into the habit of doing.
I will be super motivated to want to do something and within an hour, write down ideas,
plan out what I will be doing and how I will be doing it.  I will research as much as
I can within that amount of time and really find all the determination I can to learn
what I need to learn.  This will include bookmarking a million websites I think will be
useful, finding all the books on the topic, and looking up all the tutorials I can.</p>

            <a href="/personal/2013/09/06/create-small-goals/">Create Small Goals to Improve - 06 Sep 2013</a>
                      <p>This is on a little bit of a personal note as well but I thought that it would be worth sharing.
Right now is the beginning of the fall time and this is the time when people are beginning to go
back to school and start up class again.  Now, I am currently out of school and working so this
does not really affect me nearly as much as I am currently working but the timeline naturally
fits to create some fall goals for myself.</p>

                      <p>I am currently flying back from a trip to Salt Lake City and decided to post something
more of a personal thought.  I have had some stressful times as of recently and it has
been something that has kept me more on my feet beyond anything.  It also has given me
a realization about our drives and motivations.</p>

            <a href="/posts/2013/08/26/13-writing-things-down/">Writing Things Down - 26 Aug 2013</a>
                      <p>I have noticed a trend with writing things down going in two pathes.  The first path is the path which you write everything down and try to keep track of everything you write.
The other is the exact counter-part which is not writing anything down in the mind that you find it hopeless since you will lose it anyways.  There are valid reasonings for
both of these sort of methodologies to writing things down.  You may want to write everything down so you can keep track of all your information and make sure you don&#39;t
lose track of any of your thoughts.  One big drawback to this is that you can lose yourself in this mental library of items without some sort of organization system.
If you were to write down all your ideas and had no way of mentally mapping yourself back to this, why would you write things down?  Which brings forth the other end of
the spectrum which is not writing anything down because you know you will lose track of it anyways.  Though another big drawback to something like this is forgetfulness.</p>

            <a href="/posts/2013/08/17/what-is-a-td/">What is a TD? - 17 Aug 2013</a>
                      <p>I always have conversations with friends and strangers.  One of the questions that always seem to arise is &quot;What is a Technial Director?&quot;.
I am sure you may be asking yourself the same question and to be honest, there is a lot of generality when looking at the name Technical Director.
Now I am speaking not as a veteran in the industry but merely a student and recent TD which may help people better understand what a Technical Director
is.</p>

            <a href="/posts/2013/08/12/new-beginning/">A New Beginning - 12 Aug 2013</a>
                      <p>This is definitely the start of something new and fun.  I have so many ideas and was once
told that only a fool wouldn&#39;t write their ideas down and share them with the world.  So,
this is the start of that.  I am starting this off by just introducing myself.  My name
is Stephen Lu.  I am currently a Pipeline Tools Technical Director at Reel FX Animation
Studios.  I am currently located in Dallas and loving the journey I am on.  I am constantly
driving to learn more and share the knowledge I have found.  I have been always looking
at new opportunities and hope to share my journey with other people.  I also look to inspire
those wanting to be in the film/visual effects industry that are just starting out.</p>
