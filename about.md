Stephen Lu

I am currently working as a Pipeline Technical Director and Developer at Blur Studio in Los Angeles, California.
Previous to this, I was working as a Technical Director at Reel FX animation studios in Dallas, Texas. I am currently working on a brand new production pipeline with many talented and amazing developers and interacting with many artists including modelers, layout artists, animators, riggers, and lighters.
Previously, I was working at Rhythm and Hues as a pipeline technical director.
