    I am currently working as a Pipeline Technical Director and Developer
    at Blur Studio in Los Angeles, California.  Previous to this, I was
    working as a Technical Director at Reel FX animation studios in Dallas,
    Texas.  I am currently working on a brand new production pipeline with
    many talented and amazing developers and interacting with many artists
    including modelers, layout artists, animators, riggers, and lighters.
    Previously, I was working at Rhythm and Hues as a pipeline
    technical director.
